Pytorch implementation of some generative models


The fmri preprocessing for sub01 is done using fsl

- Motion Correction concatenating all the func files across runs and sessions of "faces" task
- Registration to highres T1 anatomical image in the subject space - the T1w of the second session
- Registration to the standard MNI space T1w 2mm

- Inversion of the MNI atlas from MNI to subject space 


TO DO:
- Voxel selection and volume crop 
- GLM over the reduced volumes
